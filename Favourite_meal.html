            It is arguable that every individual on planet earth should have a meal that no matter how it is made they'll always eat it(their favourite meal)<br/>
            Well for me my own favourite meal is Banga Stew with Rice popularly known and called  "Ofe akwu" by the Igbo people.
        </p1>

    <section>
        <h2>The Origin</h2>
        <p>The origin of Banga stew can be traced to the igbo people situated at the eastern part of Nigeria. </br> It is popularly called "Ofe Akwu" which means soup made from palm fruit in other words palmfruit soup.<br>So the interpretation will make you understand that the main ingredient for this soup is <b>"Palmfruit"</b><br>The eastern state that really likes this stew and is one of their cultural meal is Anambra. </p>
        <h3><em>Note: This soup/stew can be eaten together with rice, garri etc Your choice as you wish. But as for me I really enjoy it with boiled rice that has some green beans and carrot.</em></h3>

        <h4>Steps to prepare Banga Soup/Stew</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt><i id="Step One">Step One:</i><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Soak the dried fish in hot water and wash thoroughly to remove sand and dirt,</li>
                  <li>blend the crayfish or blend with dry pepper if you are making banga stew with dried pepper.</li>
            </ul>
            </dt>
           <dt><i>Step Two:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Chop the onion and scent leaves, set aside in a plate, I like to make most foods with lots of onions just because of its health benefits.</li>
            </ul>
            </dt>
            <dt><i>Step Three:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the palm fruits (banga fruits) for 30 to 50 minutes then pound with a mortar and pestle, you will see how this is done in the video below.</li>

             </ul>
             </dt>
             <dt><i>Step Four:</i>
            <ul>
               <li>Pour water in a bowl, add the pounded palm fruit and try to squeeze out the thick paste.</li>
               <li><b>Reminder:</b>The palm fruit juice is a major part of banga stew that can also be used in making other Nigerian soups.</li>
                <li>Pour the squeezed-out thick juice into a bowl and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </dt>
         <dt><i>Step Five:</i>
           <ul>
            <li>Wash the meat and mackerel (fish) with water and parboil with a separate pot till it is tender. Season with 2 stock cubes, a teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions).</li>
            <li>Remove the fish after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is possible to make a delicious meal with tasteless meat, that is the only reason I precook the fish/meat separate before adding them to the main pot.</li>
           </ul>
         </dt>
          <dt><i>Step Six:</i>
          <ul>
            <li>Add the squeezed-out palm fruit juice to the boiling meat on fire. <br><img src="https://allnigerianfoods.com/wp-content/uploads/making-banga-stew.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" alt="squeezed palmfruit juice"></li>
            <li>Add the (washed, dried fish and blended crayfish) to the cooking pot and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
          </ul>
          </dt>
           <dt><i>Step Seven:</i>
          <ul>
            <li>Add your spices if it is not yet as tasteful as required. (Sachet of “onga soup” and/or a seasoning cube). Stir and add the scent leave (chopped), sliced onions, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the precooked mackerel fish. I added the fish now because I want to serve them whole. If you add fish earlier to banga stew, they would break before the stew is made.</li>
          </ul>
           </dt>
           <dt><i>Step Eight:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover and cook for another minute then add the chopped vegetables (Ugu)(optional), allow to simmer for another 3 minutes and you just made a delicious Nigerian banga stew (ofe akwu)</li>
                <li><b>Serve your Banga Stew/Soup</b>with rice, yam, beans etc <small>and some soft drink to take it down slowly</small></li>
